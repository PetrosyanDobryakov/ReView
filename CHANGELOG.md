# Changelog

## 0.10.0 — 2026-08-23

### Rebrand
- Product renamed to **ReView** across storage keys, WS room, docs, and server logs.
- Board name on screen is editable (click it in the header); default `ReView`.
- Object counter moved from the header brand to the presence island.

### Fixes
- Right-click no longer collapses a multi-selection; copy/delete/duplicate act on the whole selection.
- Ctrl+V prefers the board clipboard; system clipboard is used when the board buffer is empty.
- Pasted groups land centered in the current view instead of off-screen.

### Image crop rework
- Crop is non-destructive: the original image is kept, crop is stored as a display window.
- While editing frames the full original shows as a dimmed ghost layer; frames can extend beyond the visible part.
- Double-click an image to edit its crop frame; click empty space or press Enter to apply, Esc cancels.
- Context menu gains «Reset crop» for cropped images.
